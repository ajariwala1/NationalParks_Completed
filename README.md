# NationalParks

This is the National Parks application. The app displays an intro screen when launched for the first time. From the main screen, users can select a state to discover its national parks. Parks are displayed in a grid view, and tapping on any park provides detailed information. All data is fetched from the NPS API.

⚠️ IMPORTANT: The app won't work as-is. You need to register and get your own API key from the National Park Service API to use the app.
